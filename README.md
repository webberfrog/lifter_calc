# Powerlifting Score Visualizer

A Python tool for calculating and visualizing powerlifting scores â€” **GL Points** and **DOTS Score** â€” based on an athlete's bodyweight and powerlifting total.

This tool supports both **male** and **female** coefficient systems, and generates:
- 3D surface plots for GL and DOTS scores
- A 2D line plot of GL Points vs. Total at a fixed bodyweight
- Numerical derivatives of the scores with respect to bodyweight
